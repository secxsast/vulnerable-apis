# vulnerable-apis
vulnerable APIs inspired by https://github.com/mattvaldes/vulnerable-api

# Setup

## Docker
### If, Out of the box
`docker pull kmmanoj/vulnerable-apis` (may be outdated with respect to the current state of the repo)

### Else, Build the application as docker image (preferred)
`docker build -t kmmanoj/vulnerable-apis .`

### Finally, Run the application as docker container
`docker run --name vuln-api-instance --rm -it -p 5000:5000 kmmanoj/vulnerable-apis`

## Traditional way

Create a python virtual environment: `virtualenv venv`

Activate the virtual environment: `source ./venv/bin/activate`

Install the dependencies: `pip install -r src/requirements.txt`

Start the application with specific environment variables: `TRANSIENT_DB=true python src/main.py`

## Fork the collection and the environment in Postman
Open Postman (desktop agent preferrably)

Fork the collection and environment to your own workspace by clicking the **Run in Postman** button below.

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/17042069-561f3e8f-acc9-4909-8157-c69353630e95?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D17042069-561f3e8f-acc9-4909-8157-c69353630e95%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3De75d51a3-60cc-4e4c-9abd-92a87046399c#?env%5BThe%20Good%20Bank%20Environment%5D=W3sia2V5IjoiaG9zdCIsInZhbHVlIjoiaHR0cDovL3NlY3VyaXR5LnBvc3RtYW4tYnJlYWthYmxlLmNvbSIsImVuYWJsZWQiOnRydWV9XQ==)

Or separately, fork the [collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-live/collection/17042069-561f3e8f-acc9-4909-8157-c69353630e95) to a workspace of your choice.

And fork the [environment](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-live/environment/17042069-1e57b415-ab9e-4028-bb73-b276d28458ac) to the same workspace where you forked the above collection.

Set the initial value and current value of the `host` variable to `http://localhost:5000` 

Go back to the collections and start hacking!

## Using util (if using the docker setup)

Login to the container

`docker exec -it vuln-api-instance /bin/bash`

Navigate to `/util` to use the JWT token break(or)make tool.
  
`cd /util`

### Usage of JWT Token break(or)make

```
Usage:
	python3 brute_force_jwt_token.py make - to create a token using a leaked secret
	python3 brute_force_jwt_token.py break - to find the secret used by JWT token
```

__NOTE__: For non-containerized deployments, find the util directory in the repository itself. The required dependencies are already installed in the virtual environment.

# Performance

## example
```bash
$ ab -n 5000 -c 100 -T 'application/json' -p login.json http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/login
```
